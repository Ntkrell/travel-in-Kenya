## How to get there:
1. Fly: I booked two tickets just a week before leaving: from Nanyuki to Wilson then Wilson to Diani. Can book flights through these sites:
* airkenya.com
* safarilink.com
* fly-sax.com
2. Take the train! It takes five hours from Nairobi to Mombassa then you take the ferry from Mombassa to Diani. 
* [Here](http://krc.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MADARAKA-EXPRESS-TRAIN-SCHEDULE.pdf) is the schedule.
* Book your tickets as soon as they become available: one week before
