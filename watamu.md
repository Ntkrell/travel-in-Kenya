## How to get there:
* Can fly Wilson to Malindi using Silverstone air ($60 one way if you buy early). Malindi to Watamu is an easy 25 minute drive. Should cost $20-25 USD if organized by the hotel. Can also fly from Mombasa but then it's a 2-2.5 hour drive. 

## Where to stay:
* [Hemingways](https://www.hemingways-collection.com) - newly renovated with reduced prices for residents. Half-board includes buffet breakfast and three-course dinner featuring pescatarian, carnivore, and vegetation options. 
* [Watamu Treehouse](watamutreehouse.co.ke): have to pay fully in advance because it is a popular place. Unique structure designed by owner of Kitengela glass. Also functions as a yoga retreat center so ideal for those who want a zen experience.  Several activities to choose. During new/full moon cycles, you can "float" down a channel in a mangrove forest and have a swahili breakfast on the beach -- highly recommend!
