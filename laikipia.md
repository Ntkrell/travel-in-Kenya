### Where to stay:
* [Sirikoi Lodge at Lewa Conservancy](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g612348-d1877743-Reviews-Sirikoi-Nanyuki_Town_Nanyuki_Municipality_Laikipia_County_Rift_Valley_Province.html) - costs an arm and a leg but supposedly Kenya's leading luxury lodge.
* [Sieku Moja](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17585693?source=handoff-ios&s=39&ref_device_id=19c8d14770c896fff550fd48792009a6af7885fa&user_id=36788048&_branch_match_id=515176293779556674) - looks like an incredible glamping experience at an affordable price.
* [R-Villa](https://goo.gl/maps/SY9aMfoNzwM2) - If you happen to find yourself in Rumuruti, this is the place to stay. 1000 KES will get you a private room in a 2-room villa with your own toilet and hot shower. Not a bad deal. Another option in Rumuruti is El Pairiso but it is a 3-story building that also hosts a bar/club. I'm fairly certain it doubles as a brothel. R- stands for Rumuruti) Villa, on the other hand, is quiet and safe. There is a restaurant with decent food, but it will take anywhere between 2 and 4 hours for them to make something, so plan well in advance. Breakfast comes out fairly quickly (maybe 15-20 minutes). The power was out about 15% of the time, but there is a generator.
