*Note*, Lamau is on the state department travel warning list. I did not go to Lamu but it seems amazing.

## How to get there:
* [Fly 540](https://www.fly540.com/lamu.php)
* [Airkenya](airkenya.com)
* [Safarilink](flysafarilink.com)


## Where to stay:
* [The Majilis](https://themajlisresorts.com) - very expensive
* [New Bahati Lodge](lamuguesthouse.com) - master bedroom at the top of the house has the best views; 1400 ksh for a double
* [Subira House](subirahouse.com) - 5000-800 ksh per night.
